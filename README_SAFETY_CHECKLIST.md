Safety & compliance checklist
-----------------------------
- Scope: limit to declared subreddits; no DMs, no voting/karma actions, no cross-posting.
- Transparency: descriptive User-Agent (`server:app-name:version (by /u/botuser)`); use dedicated bot account.
- Frequency: keep reads modest (e.g., hourly) and posts max weekly. Monitor `X-Ratelimit-*` headers.
- Data handling: only public content; transient processing; purge summaries/logs within 48h; honor deletions immediately.
- No commercialization or AI training: do not sell/share data, do not train models, no ads targeting.
- Devvit rationale: needs scheduled cross-subreddit aggregation, webhook delivery, and cron-based runs outside Devvit.
- Logging: keep structured logs minimal and scrub PII; rotate and purge.
- Config hygiene: validate `.env` (no placeholders), commit only `.env.example`/`config.example.yaml`, never secrets.
- Posting: only if moderators approve; default to report-only.
- Subreddit permissions: if you are not a moderator, obtain written mod approval before operating the bot.
